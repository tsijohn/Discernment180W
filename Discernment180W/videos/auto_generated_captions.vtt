1
00:00:02.525 --> 00:00:05.165
I felt very stuck in not knowing which direction to go.

2
00:00:05.425 --> 00:00:07.725
Um, very paralyzed in my actions. So

3
00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:09.085
I'd thought and discerned the

4
00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:10.445
priesthood for about 12 years.

5
00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:13.125
It was a lot more of discerning discernment.

6
00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:14.685
I'd never considered discernment

7
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:15.685
before someone reached out to me.

8
00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:17.445
I didn't know how to discern. Kind

9
00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:19.125
of just kept it at the back of my mind.

10
00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.085
At some point in our relationship with the Lord,

11
00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:23.845
especially in high school, college,

12
00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:27.045
or the early years of a career, our willingness to say,

13
00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:28.605
yes, I will follow you.

14
00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.365
Jesus ought to be expressed with the honest question.

15
00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:34.965
How do you want me to follow you, Jesus, for the disciple,

16
00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:37.565
the question is not whether he has a plan,

17
00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:39.165
whether his plans are good,

18
00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:41.165
or even whether I will follow his plans.

19
00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:44.005
The question is, what are his plans?

20
00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:46.485
My name is Father Greg Gerhardt.

21
00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.605
I'm the vocation director in the Diocese of Austin.

22
00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:50.805
And for the past several years, I've been walking

23
00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:53.365
with young men seeking to answer that question,

24
00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:55.845
and I've been able to recommend Good Books,

25
00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:57.925
host discernment retreats,

26
00:00:57.985 --> 00:00:59.845
and put on all kinds of events

27
00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:02.045
to help people discern God's will for the life.

28
00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:06.045
But I haven't seen anything bear as much fruit in the lives

29
00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:08.205
of young men as discernment 180.

30
00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.165
Discernment 180 is a six month guide

31
00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:13.565
to discern the priesthood, and six months gives time

32
00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:16.005
and space for the Lord to move in our hearts,

33
00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:18.285
to help us want what he wants

34
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.805
and strengthen us to follow wherever he leads.

35
00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:23.325
Alright, so what's involved in Discernment 180?

36
00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:26.205
Well, it consists of following a rule of life

37
00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:29.645
for six months, daily reflections in those 180 days,

38
00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:31.925
and four effective discernment actions.

39
00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:34.165
So first, the rule of life.

40
00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:37.485
It's prayer, sacrament, study, service, and virtue.

41
00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:41.205
Putting these spiritual practices in your life in an ordered

42
00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:43.645
way allows you to grow in holiness,

43
00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.605
and that's the foundation of all vocational discernment.

44
00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:49.685
Then the daily reflections, we'll be reading through St.

45
00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:53.845
Francis de Sales scripture readings, papal writings, lies

46
00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:55.965
of the Saints, and then more scripture readings.

47
00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:59.245
It's going to help you focus in your prayer for

48
00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:01.045
how the Lord is calling you to follow him.

49
00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:04.525
And then finally, the four discernment actions they include

50
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:07.285
going on a discernment retreat, visiting a seminary,

51
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:08.925
engaging in a dating fast,

52
00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:11.485
and meeting with the spiritual director.

53
00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:13.965
Now, these practices, they're nothing new.

54
00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:16.605
Spiritual directors and vocation directors have

55
00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:17.925
been recommending them for years.

56
00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:22.085
What D 180 does is put them all in one intentional period

57
00:02:22.105 --> 00:02:23.645
of discernment, and that bears

58
00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.165
so much more fruit than any one

59
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:26.565
of these actions on their own.

60
00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:30.285
Discernment 180 eliminates the problem of vague,

61
00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:31.765
haphazard discernment,

62
00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:33.805
and it helps men rise to the occasion

63
00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:35.805
of answering God's call.

64
00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.125
I've walked with men who have finished discernment 180

65
00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.965
that felt peace and freedom about moving towards marriage.

66
00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:44.485
I've walked with men who have finished discernment 180

67
00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.285
and received peace, joy,

68
00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:48.485
and zeal about following him in the priesthood.

69
00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:51.765
I haven't walked with men who are upset that they did it.

70
00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:54.365
Discernment 180 teaches the essentials

71
00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:55.725
of holiness and discernment.

72
00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:58.285
It facilitates growth in prayer and in virtue,

73
00:02:58.425 --> 00:03:01.565
and most importantly, it draws men closer to the Lord.

74
00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:03.845
Who is the only one that can answer the question?

75
00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:06.325
How do you want me to follow you? Jesus.

76
00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:09.285
Through the program, I had a structure to follow

77
00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.725
that helped me get through that process.

78
00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:13.285
Now I'm gonna be a seminarian. After

79
00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:15.045
The Sermon 180, I've peacefully closed

80
00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:16.125
the door. On the seminary,

81
00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:18.845
I was able to move forward with confidence

82
00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:20.645
to pursue engagement with my girlfriend.

83
00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:23.165
I realized my true, authentic desire to give my life over

84
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:24.325
to Christ as his priest.

85
00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:26.645
Discernment 180 is for you if you're looking

86
00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:29.165
for a concrete structure to discern your vocation.

87
00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.485
Discernment 180 is

88
00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:32.445
for you if you feel stuck in your discernment.

89
00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:33.645
Discernment 180 is for you.

90
00:03:33.745 --> 00:03:35.125
If you've never thought about the priesthood,

91
00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:37.125
Discernment 180 is for you.

92
00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.325
If you want to get outta your head,

93
00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:40.405
stop thinking and start moving.

94
00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:42.565
Are you ready to get serious about

95
00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:43.925
discerning your vocation?

96
00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:46.725
Discernment 180 is for you.
